### Hello, I'm Doug.

I'm a software engineer focused on frontend development. I take pride in problem-solving and have a knack for finding the tiniest bugs that drive many crazy. I like simplicity in life and code. 

I am currently learning Node.js and unit/functional testing in React.

The best way to find out all about me is through my [portfolio site](https://www.dougschallmoser.com/).

I can also be reached through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/doug-schallmoser/), [Email](mailto:dougschallmoser@gmail.com), and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/illbehiking/).

Fun Facts: I love hiking in the mountains!
