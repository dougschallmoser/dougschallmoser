### Hello, I'm Doug.

I'm a software developer creating technology that improves people's lives. Some technologies I enjoy working with include React.js and Rails. I enjoy problem-solving and have a knack for finding the tiniest bugs that drive many crazy. I believe simplicity and elegance produces the best code.

I am currently working on adding additional features to [Trailblaze](https://github.com/dougschallmoser/trailblaze).

The best way to find out all about me is my [personal website](https://www.dougschallmoser.com/).
