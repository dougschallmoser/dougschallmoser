### Hello, I'm Doug.

I'm a software engineer focused on creating things that improves people's lives. I love JavaScript above all else. I take pride in problem-solving and have a knack for finding the tiniest bugs that drive many crazy. I believe simplicity produces the best code.

I am currently working on converting [Trailblaze](https://github.com/dougschallmoser/trailblaze) to Typescript, as well as learning Node.js.

The best way to find out all about me is my [portfolio site](https://www.dougschallmoser.com/).

I can also be reached through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/doug-schallmoser/), [Email](mailto:dougschallmoser@gmail.com), [Blog](https://dougschallmoser.medium.com/), and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/illbehiking/).

Fun Facts: I love hiking in the mountains!
