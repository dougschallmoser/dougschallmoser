### Hello, I'm Doug.

I'm a software engineer focused on frontend development. I take pride in problem-solving and have a knack for finding the tiniest bugs that drive many crazy. I like simplicity in life and code. 

I am currently learning Node.js and testing in React.

The best way to find out all about me is my [portfolio site](https://www.dougschallmoser.com/).
