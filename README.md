### Hello, I'm Doug.

I'm a software engineer focused on creating things that improves people's lives. I love JavaScript above all else. I take pride in problem-solving and have a knack for finding the tiniest bugs that drive many crazy. I believe simplicity produces the best code.

I am currently working on adding additional features to [Trailblaze](https://github.com/dougschallmoser/trailblaze) as well as gaining experience with TypeScript and Node.js.

The best way to find out all about me is my [personal website](https://www.dougschallmoser.com/).
