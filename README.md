### Hello, I'm Doug.

I'm a software engineer focused on creating things that improves people's lives. I love JavaScript and the front end. I take pride in problem-solving and have a knack for finding the tiniest bugs that drive many crazy. I believe simplicity produces the best code.

I am currently learning Node.js and how to write tests in React.

The best way to find out all about me is my [portfolio site](https://www.dougschallmoser.com/).

Fun Facts: I love hiking in the mountains!
